# Twitch TV Adblocker

This extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store for "not respecting their publishing rules and policies". Use at your own risk.

<b>I do not own this code</b>, but I want to keep this extension up, as it is the only extension that still works as far of <b>April 6th 2022</b>.

If you're the owner of this code, please reach out to me.

Chrome may turn it off automatically sometimes, since it seems to be tied to an ID for the Chrome Web Store.

# How to install:

1. On this page, click on the green `Code` button. Select `Download ZIP`

4. Enable `Developer Mode`.
