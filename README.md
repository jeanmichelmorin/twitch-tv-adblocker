# EDIT: Use this instead.
The original owner was saucettv. The original developer added a ref link when you purchase something off Amazon. He completely disapeared with the extension. But a team of dev took care of removing that stuff. You can find the new things here.

I will keep the old code in here for archive purposes.

# Twitch TV Adblocker

This extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store for "not respecting their publishing rules and policies". Use at your own risk.

<b>I do not own this code</b>, but I want to keep this extension up, as it is the only extension that still works as far of <b>April 6th 2022</b>.

If you're the owner of this code, please reach out to me.

Chrome may turn it off automatically sometimes, since it seems to be tied to an ID for the Chrome Web Store.

# How to install:

1. On this page, click on the green `Code` button. Select `Download ZIP`
2. Unzip it anywhere in a folder, call the folder `Twitch Adblocker` (Name doesn't matter).
3. At the top of your browser, enter this following URL: `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable `Developer Mode`.
5. Click on `Load Unpacked` and select the folder with the unzipped content. (In our case, `Twitch Adblocker`)
6. Browse throught your extensions and make sure it is activated.
7. That's it.
